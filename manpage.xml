A manual page <package>.<section> will be generated. You may view the
manual page with: nroff -man <package>.<section> | less'. A typical entry
in a Makefile or Makefile.am is:

DB2MAN = /usr/share/sgml/docbook/stylesheet/xsl/nwalsh/manpages/docbook.xsl
XP     = xsltproc -''-nonet -''-param man.charmap.use.subset "0"

manpage.1: manpage.xml
        $(XP) $(DB2MAN) $<

The xsltproc binary is found in the xsltproc package. The XSL files are in
docbook-xsl. A description of the parameters you can use can be found in the
docbook-xsl-doc-* packages. Please remember that if you create the nroff
version in one of the debian/rules file targets (such as build), you will need
to include xsltproc and docbook-xsl in your Build-Depends control field.
Alternatively use the xmlto command/package. That will also automatically
pull in xsltproc and docbook-xsl.

Notes for using docbook2x: docbook2x-man does not automatically create the
AUTHOR(S) and COPYRIGHT sections. In this case, please add them manually as
<refsect1> ... </refsect1>.

To disable the automatic creation of the AUTHOR(S) and COPYRIGHT sections
read /usr/share/doc/docbook-xsl/doc/manpages/authors.html. This file can be
found in the docbook-xsl-doc-html package.

Validation can be done using: `xmllint -''-noout -''-valid manpage.xml`

    <para>This manual page documents briefly the
      <command>&dhpackage;</command> and <command>bar</command>
      commands.</para>
    <para><command>&dhpackage;</command> is a GTK+ text editor
    for ebook PDF files.</para>
    <para>Many downloaded PDF files for ebook readers still use the A4
    paper type (or letter which is similar in size) and when the PDF is
    displayed on the ebook reader, the zoom required to display the
    entire page makes the text too small. Simply exporting the PDF into
    text causes problems with line wrapping and the various ways that
    ebook PDFs indicate page headers and footers make it hard to
    automate the conversion.
    </para>
    <para><command>&dhpackage;</command> loads the PDF, extracts the
    text, reformats the paragraphs into single long lines and then puts
    the text into a standard GTK+ editor where you can make other
    adjustments.
    </para>
    <para>On the ebook reader, the plain text file then has no unwanted
    line breaks and can be zoomed to whatever text size you prefer.

      <title>Future additions</title>
      <para>The plan is to enable <command>&dhpackage;</command> to also
      save the modified text as a new PDF file as well as saving as a
      normal ASCII text file.
      </para>
      <para>Other ebook formats might be supportable, depending on
      whether there is free software support for reading the format in
      the first place.
