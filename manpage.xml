    <title>DESCRIPTION</title>
    <para>This manual page documents briefly the
      <command>&dhpackage;</command> and <command>bar</command>
      commands.</para>
    <para><command>&dhpackage;</command> is a GTK+ text editor
    for ebook PDF files.</para>
    <para>Many downloaded PDF files for ebook readers still use the A4
    paper type (or letter which is similar in size) and when the PDF is
    displayed on the ebook reader, the zoom required to display the
    entire page makes the text too small. Simply exporting the PDF into
    text causes problems with line wrapping and the various ways that
    ebook PDFs indicate page headers and footers make it hard to
    automate the conversion.
    </para>
    <para><command>&dhpackage;</command> loads the PDF, extracts the
    text, reformats the paragraphs into single long lines and then puts
    the text into a standard GTK+ editor where you can make other
    adjustments.
    </para>
    <para>On the ebook reader, the plain text file then has no unwanted
    line breaks and can be zoomed to whatever text size you prefer.
    </para>
    </refsect1>

    <title>Limitations</title>
      <para>ebook PDF files often contain headers and footers - chapter and
      book titles as well as page numbers. These count as part of the text of
      the PDF file and are retained by <command>&dhpackage;</command>. As these
      are often specific to any one book, it is hard to reliably remove these and
      yet the insertions will disrupt the flow of the text.
      </para>
      <para>Currently, the only solution is to edit the text before saving.
      </para>
      <para>If the text from the PDF cannot be reliably converted into ASCII
      text, the text will be omitted, usually one page at a time - more
      examples of PDF files that suffer from these issues would be helpful.
      </para>
    </refsect1>
    <refsect1>
      <title>Future additions</title>
      <para>The plan is to enable <command>&dhpackage;</command> to also
      save the modified text as a new PDF file as well as saving as a
      normal ASCII text file.
      </para>
      <para>Other ebook formats might be supportable, depending on
      whether there is free software support for reading the format in
      the first place. 
      </para>
      <para>Some form of search/replace will be needed in the editor as well - more
      than just the default Find and Find Next. Spelling support could also help
      identify areas where the text has not been fully reconstructed.
