gPDFText 0.0.1 ("getting started")
=================================

	* Features:
	- Uses poppler-glib to read in text content from PDF
		files.
		: Remove line wrapping and restore original
			paragraphs.
		: Rejoin words separated by hyphens.
		: Saves text as simple ASCII content.
	- Simple GTK+ interface with instant-apply GConf
		preferences.
	- Selectable editor font.
	- GtkSpell support.
	- Uses GtkBuilder support in latest GTK+.
	- Minimal dependencies, small binary.
	- gPDFText Manual via yelp.
	- German and Russian translations of program
		output and the gPDFText Manual.

	* Future additions:
	- The plan is to enable gPDFText to also save the
		modified text as a new PDF file as well as saving
		as a normal ASCII text file.
	- Other ebook formats might be supportable, depending
		on whether there is free software support for
		reading the format in the first place.
