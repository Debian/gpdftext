<!-- ============= Introduction ============================== -->
<!-- Use the Introduction section to give a brief overview of what
     the application is and what it does. -->

<sect1 id="gpdftext-introduction">
	<title>Introduction</title>
	<para>
	<command>&app;</command> is a GTK+ text editor
	for ebook PDF files.</para>
	<para>
	&app; allows you to load the text from an ebook PDF file and
	restore a more natural flow to the story.
	</para>
	<para>
	Many downloaded PDF files for ebook readers still use the A4
	paper type (or letter which is similar in size) and when the PDF is
	displayed on the ebook reader, the zoom required to display the
	entire page makes the text too small. Simply exporting the PDF into
	text causes problems with line wrapping and the various ways that
	ebook PDFs indicate page headers and footers make it hard to
	automate the conversion.
	</para>
	<para>
	<command>&app;</command> loads the PDF, extracts the
	text, reformats the paragraphs into single long lines and then puts
	the text into a standard GTK+ editor where you can make other
	adjustments.
	</para>
	<para>
	On the ebook reader, the plain text file then has no unwanted
	line breaks and can be zoomed to whatever text size you prefer.
	</para>
	<para>
	Each reformatting option can be turned off using the &app;
	preferences window. See <link linkend="regexps">changing regular
	expressions</link>.
	</para>
	<para>
	Spelling support helps identify areas where further editing may
	be needed or where page titles still remain in the extracted text.
	</para>
	<para>
	The extracted and edited text can be saved as a new PDF file
	based on more useful paper sizes (A5 or B5) so that the ebook reader
	can display the entire page at a time at a comfortable zoom. Once
	saved, the PDF can be updated from within the editor.
	</para>
	<para>
	Any text file can also be opened and written out as a PDF,
	although files passed to &app; on the command line need to be
	of PDF type.
	</para>

<!-- =========== Getting Started ============================== -->
<!-- Use the Getting Started section to describe the steps required
     to start the application and to describe the user interface components
     of the application. If there is other information that it is important
     for readers to know before they start using the application, you should
     also include this information here.
     If the information about how to get started is very short, you can
     include it in the Introduction and omit this section. -->

<!-- ============= Customization ============================= -->
<!-- Use this section to describe how to customize the application. -->
<sect1 id="regexps">
	<title>Selecting regular expressions</title>
		<para>Preferences provide ways to customise &app; to suit
		how a particular PDF file was prepared. 
		Choose <menuchoice> <guisubmenu>Edit</guisubmenu>
		<guimenuitem>Preferences</guimenuitem></menuchoice> or
		click the preferences button on the toolbar to show the
		preferences window.
		</para>
	<para>
		&app; makes three sets of changes to the text extracted from the
		ebook PDF file which can be disabled by the user, depending on
		how the opened PDF file was prepared.
	</para>
	<sect2 id="longlines">
		<title>Long lines support.</title>
		<para>Most users will retain this setting which joins single lines
		back into original paragraphs so that the reader can format the
		long lines cleanly.

		Otherwise you end up with the text of your novel
		appearing like this
		when it should really be a single paragraph.

	<sect2 id="hyphens">
		<title>Collapsing hyphenated words.</title>
		<para>Most users will also retain this setting which joins up
		hyphenated words which would otherwise appear in the middle of

	<sect2 id="pagenum">
		<title>Removing page number footers.</title>
		<para>Only the simplest page number footers can be removed using
		this method. If your PDF contains the book name, chapter name or
		some other content (like an advert for the download site) in the
		page footer, you will need to remove such footers manually.
		</para>
		<para>In some cases, the page number pattern (whitespace, numbers
		and a line ending) can cause problems with some books. &app;
		may then skip entire pages from the PDF, so disable this option
		and re-open the PDF.

		of the PDF is reduced from the default A4. A4 remains an option

<!-- ============= FAQ ============================= -->
<!-- Use this section to list frequently-asked questions. -->

<sect1 id="gpdftext-faq">
	<title>Frequently Asked Questions</title>
	<sect2 id="opening-pdf">
		<title>Creating text based PDF files for other uses</title>
		<para>Creating text-based PDF files in &app; can mean that
		the resulting PDF does not provide text content when the
		PDF is opened by &app;, depending on the kind of text content.
		</para>
		<para>Where the text content is a story or novel, this should
		be reported as a bug. Where the text content is some other kind
		of text file (like a source code file or other a file with a
		similarly strict format), the original file should be reopened
		instead of extracting from the PDF.
		</para>
		<para>In particular, &app; is not able to extract text from
		PDF files that put text into tables or non-paragraph styles.
		</para>
	</sect2>
	<sect2 id="future">
		<title>Future additions</title>
		<para>Other ebook formats might be supportable, depending on
		whether there is free software support for reading the format in
		the first place. 
		</para>
		<para>Some form of search/replace will be needed in the editor as well - more
		than just the default Find and Find Next. Spelling support could also help
		identify areas where the text has not been fully reconstructed.
